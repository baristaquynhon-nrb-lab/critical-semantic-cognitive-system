# ARCHITECTURE LAYERS — NRB-Aligned Critical Semantic Cognitive System

This system is designed as a **Deterministic, Law-Tracking Semantic Cognitive Architecture** aligned with NRB principles.

---

## LAYER 1 — Signal / Input Layer

Raw structured input enters the system.

Function:
• Receive structured data
• Canonicalize input
• Generate input hash

---

## LAYER 2 — Evidence Binding Layer

Purpose: Transform input into stable evidence units.

Function:
• Bind observations to canonical representation
• Produce evidence hash
• Ensure determinism

---

## LAYER 3 — Meaning Stabilization Layer

Purpose: Convert evidence into semantic stability.

Function:
• Map evidence → meaning units
• Maintain meaning state
• Track semantic drift

---

## LAYER 4 — Law Evaluation Layer

Purpose: Evaluate meaning under formal law structures.

Function:
• Apply law algebra
• Compute verdict
• Detect contradictions

---

## LAYER 5 — Action Policy Layer

Purpose: Transform law verdict into executable policy.

Function:
• Map verdict → constrained action
• Preserve traceability
• Enforce safety bounds
